# Applied GLM Modeling in R – Data Science Master (UNED)

This repository contains a complete predictive modeling project developed in R as part of the "Generalized Linear Models" module (Module 3) of the Master in Big Data and Data Science Applied to Economics and Business at UNED (2024–2025).

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to apply Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to business-related data using R. The project includes the entire modeling pipeline:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and validation
- Linear and generalized linear regression (Poisson, Logistic)
- Use of `caret` for model training and evaluation
- Model diagnostics and interpretation

## 🔧 Tools and Packages

- R and RStudio  
- caret, ggplot2, dplyr, broom, MASS  
- HTML output generated with RMarkdown  

## 📄 Output

The final report is included in the file:  
📎 `Oscar_Porta_Examen-2025-Modulo-3.html`

It contains code, visualizations, interpretations, and conclusions written from a professional data science perspective.
